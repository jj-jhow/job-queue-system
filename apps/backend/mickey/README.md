# Mickey Worker Application

## Overview
Mickey is an application designed to orchestrate jobs by distributing different processing steps to specialized worker services. Certain steps of a job are processed by Sora, while other steps are handled by Riku. Mickey manages this workflow, ensuring tasks are routed efficiently. This application is built with TypeScript and utilizes modern JavaScript features.

## Installation

```
npm run dev
```

This will run the application in development mode with hot reloading.

## Building
To compile the TypeScript files into JavaScript, run:

```

```

This will generate the output files in the designated build directory.

## Usage
